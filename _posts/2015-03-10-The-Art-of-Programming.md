title: The Art of Programming

What do you think the most important characteristic of a programmer.Many  people think that writing space and  time efficient code is most important.Yes i agree to that ,but in my opinion writing code which is generic and scale-able is important.Its not easy to develop this skill,you get it only through practice.Lets say for example you want to add two numbers.The input numbers can be integers or fractions and the input size may not fit it in the integer datatype.Also you have to consider how frequently this function is called and how many users are using it.So while developing any feature think in this  terms  and design  your code.
