**Broadband Connectivity through TV White Spaces**
A new technology is emerging ,which uses TV white spaces to provide broadband connectivity. If you look at places like hilly areas and remote villages ,there will be no internet connectivity.It will be very expensive and hard for laying cables and provide internet.So the only promising approach is to use  wireless technologies.
In recent times  the analog TV broadcasting channels are converted to digital.This emptied lot of frequency spaces in the TV channels.Scientists are planning to  use these empty spaces to carry broadband data.Recent studies in US and Europe show that most the frequencies are empty.In fact we carried experiments in India and found out that there are many empty channels.([paper](http://www.sandeepgoli.com/resources/wsd_paper.pdf)) .Because the frequency band between 400MHZ to 1GHZ  are an excellent carrier for long distance broadband connectivity ,we could some how utilize these spaces for providing connectivity to rural areas.
