title: Noobs Theory of Universe
---
In recent times I have been thinking a lot about Universe.There are many unanswered questions.Whenever I visit a temple,there are many questions that comes to my mind.Where did the humans come from? Who created the Universe? Does God really exist?If yes,Does he have control on you?  Why do we pray to God,Does anybody's wish got fulfilled without putting any effort.Nobody has answers to these questions. In this article ,I will not be answering any of these questions.But I will try to develop a theory which parallels ,how humans live in this Universe. I named the theory noobs ,because I don't have any knowledge about astronomy or biology.

If you look at things around you.Everything is made of infinite possibilities("infinte" which means humans cannot calculate or it is a very large number) or in other words its random.How many colors can we create based on basic RGB?How many specifies are there on our  Earth.How many atoms are there ? From all these examples one thing is clear ,there is a basic thing  from which all these possibilities are created.Many scientists tried to put entire Universe in one equation.I think it is possible,but will be very difficult unless we understand completely about our Universe.

So the first statement I am making is every thing in Universe has life.The Earth,Sun and other planets or stars or rocks has life.We humans are like bacteria who is feeding on Earth and earth is like a bacteria who is feeding on our universe and so on.... I know ,this is a bold statement without any proof.But If you look at patterns in Universe,this theory cannot be ruled out.
I will be adding more about this in part 2
